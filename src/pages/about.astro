        <h2 class="mb-4">My Mission</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">
          RehabRate was created with a simple yet powerful mission: to bring transparency and accountability to addiction treatment. I believe that everyone deserves access to high-quality, effective treatment options that are right for their unique needs.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="mb-4">Who I Am</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">
          RehabRate was founded by someone who has been through multiple rehab experiences firsthand. After struggling with addiction and going through several treatment programs, I've gained direct insight into what actually works and what doesn't. This personal journey has given me a unique perspective on what makes treatment effective and what information people need when making these crucial decisions.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="mb-4">What I Do</h2>
        <p class="mb-8">
          RehabRate provides a platform for real people to share their experiences with addiction treatment centers. Reviews are verified for authenticity, and centers are rated based on personal experience and real outcomes rather than marketing promises. My goal is to help you find the right treatment option faster, with more confidence, and better outcomes.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="mb-4">My Values</h2>
        <ul class="values-list mb-8">
          <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> I believe in full disclosure about treatment options, pricing, and outcomes.</li>
          <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> All reviews on this platform come from real people with real experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> I make it easy to find the information you need when you need it most.</li>
          <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> Having faced addiction myself, I understand the challenges and approach this work with genuine empathy.</li>
          <li><strong>Reality-Based:</strong> I prioritize what actually works in real life, not just what looks good on paper.</li>
